It means (I think): \"Tim dealt with it but it wasn't without consquences.\"</del><br /><br />Edit by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/samuel.latchman\">Sam Latchman</a>:<br /> <mark>\"Essuyer les plâtres\" is actually \"wipe off the plaster\". That's when the coating walls in your new place are so freshly and recently done that you have to clean the last dust and specks adhering to it. Nowadays it means taking care of the last small issues of something newly created. The closest English equivalent would be \"iron out the kinks\".</mark>"
